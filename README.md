# Swallow Squad
My entry for [Strawberry Jam](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam). It's a game about a big blue dragon who saves people from natural disasters - by swallowing them, obviously. It's also the first game I ever made!

Makes use of the font "Star Perv", from [Anna Anthrophy's World of Fonts](https://w.itch.io/world-of-fonts).

# Running the Game
Swallow Squad requires the löve framework, which can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). Download the game, descend into the root directory, and run with the following:
```bash
love .
```

Instructions on building the game to run as a standalone executable (useful if you don't want to install löve) can be found [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution).
